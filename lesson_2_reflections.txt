How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area are files that are ready to be committed. Working directory has files are not ready to be committed and will not be part of the commit.
the value it offers is to allow you to choose some files to be committed while others are still be working on (not ready for commit).
